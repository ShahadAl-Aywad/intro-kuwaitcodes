My name is Shahad Al-Aywad and I attend Al-Hayat Universal Bilingual School.
I am entering the eleventh grade in the upcoming year and I am hoping to expand my ability in programming and coding. 
I am striving to do so in order to broaden my background knowledge and to vary my career choices in the future.
 As online technology becomes more and more significant, I believe possessing programming skills is becoming more and more essential for development.
